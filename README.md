INTRO:
  I created this game while doing a course from udemy (title:"The Complete JavaScript Course 2019:Build Real Projects!") which is a very detailed course having video tutorials of 28 hours length.
  This a simple Bank game and its rules are stated below.
    
GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
Additional features:
-1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
-2. An input field is added to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100. 
-3. Another dice is added to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.
